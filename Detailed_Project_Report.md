# Spam Email Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

## Abstract

Email spam has become a significant challenge in digital communication, affecting productivity, security, and resource utilization. This project presents SafeMailAI, an intelligent spam email classification system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The system employs a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier combined with text vectorization to automatically distinguish between legitimate (ham) and spam emails. Using a dataset of 5,572 emails, we implemented a comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline and feature extraction using CountVectorizer. The model achieved 97.8% accuracy in classification, with 96.5% precision and 98.2% recall on the test dataset. A user-friendly web interface was developed using Streamlit, enabling real-time email classification with an average response time of 0.1 seconds. The system's architecture ensures scalability and maintainability, while its modular design allows for future enhancements. This solution demonstrates the effective application of machine learning in solving real-world communication challenges, providing a robust foundation for email security and management.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

In today's digital age, email has become an indispensable communication tool for both personal and professional use. However, the proliferation of unwanted spam emails poses significant challenges to users and organizations alike. Spam emails not only consume valuable time and resources but also present potential security risks through phishing attempts and malware distribution.

The challenge lies in developing an automated system that can effectively distinguish between legitimate emails (ham) and spam emails. Traditional rule-based filtering methods often fail to adapt to evolving spam techniques, necessitating a more sophisticated approach using machine learning and natural language processing.
